## Installation
Windows: Put the plugin (.dll) in %appdata%/Exiled/Plugins

## Settings:
Settings are yet to be implemented, I aim to make my plugins highly dynamic and customizable so anyone can use them in any situation.

## Contributing and editing
I allow people to modify this plugin to suite their need as long as I am credited for the original work.
